This project includes Communication Modulation techniques along with Reflection Models and Diffraction Gain source code in Python.

## Modulation

Modulation, in electronics, is a technique for impressing information (voice, music, picture, or data) on a radio-frequency carrier wave by varying one or more characteristics of the wave in accordance with the intelligence signal. 
The most commonly altered characteristics include amplitude, frequency, phase, pulse sequence, and pulse duration.

There are various forms of modulation, each designed to alter a particular characteristic of the carrier wave.

  # Analog Modulation
    a. Analog modulation refers to the process of transferring an analog baseband (low frequency) signal, like an audio or TV signal over a higher frequency signal such as a radio frequency band.
    b. Analog Modulation, in turn, has two forms -- Amplitude and Angle Modulations. Angle Modulation contains Frequency and Phase Modulations.
      1. Amplitude Modulation
        a. Amplitude modulation is a process by which the wave signal is transmitted by modulating the amplitude of the signal.
        b. It is often called AM and is commonly used in transmitting a piece of information through a radio carrier wave.
        c. Amplitude Modulation includes various forms - Full AM (DSB), DSB-SC, SSB, VSB.
        d. VSB Modulation is used for Video
      2. Angle Modulation
        a. Angle modulation is defined as the process in which either the frequency or the phase of the carrier signal varies with respect to the message signal.

  # Digital Modulation
    a. Digital modulation is the process of encoding a digital information signal into the amplitude, phase, or frequency of the transmitted signal.
    b. The encoding process affects the bandwidth of the transmitted signal and its robustness to channel impairments.
